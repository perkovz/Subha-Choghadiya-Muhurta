# Subha Choghadiya Muhurta

A clean, privacy-first Chromimum extension that reveals today's **auspicious** and **inauspicious** time windows according to Vedic tradition. All calculated from your city's real sunrise and sunset. No personal data is collected.

### What is Choghadiya Muhurta?

Choghadiya Muhurta is an ancient Vedic system that divides the day (sunrise to sunset) and night (sunset to sunrise) into eight equal periods of roughly 96 minutes each. Each period is ruled by one of the seven classical planets, coloring it with distinct energy:

- **Auspicious** slots (Amrit, Shubh, Labh, Char) — governed by benefic planets like Moon, Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus — support new beginnings, travel, business, or important tasks.
- **Inauspicious** slots (Udveg, Rog, Kaal) — influenced by Sun, Mars, and Saturn — carry heavier or disruptive currents, so tradition recommends postponing major actions.

By choosing favorable windows, you align effort with the day's natural rhythm—small choices that often lead to smoother outcomes over time.

### Additional Key Timings

- **Abhijit Muhurat** — A powerful ~48-minute midday victory window (around noon) that overrides most obstacles and blesses any significant start.
- **Rahu Kaal** — A ~90-minute inauspicious stretch (weekday-specific) ruled by shadow planet Rahu—best avoided for new ventures, journeys, or ceremonies.
- **Kaal Vela / Vaar Vela** — Daytime inauspicious periods to sidestep for auspicious activities.
- **Kaal Ratri** — Nighttime counterpart, similarly cautioned against major beginnings.
